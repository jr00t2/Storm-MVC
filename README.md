# Storm-MVC
This is a lightweight PHP MVC Framework which is built to provide basic functions for querying a database and building agile web applications by using MVC patterns.
Out of the box this Framework provides AngularJS, JQuery (version 1.1.1 Minified) and Bootstrap but doesn't depend on them.

This Framework aims to provide easy installation, more clean code and a solid performance.

#How to

All you have to do is downloading this framework and copy it over to an Apache / IIS server (webspace folder).
Check the Example Views/Controllers and Models - build your own, connect to your database (by changing the DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS variables in the config.php file to fit your mysql/Database configuration) and you are ready to go.

#LICENSE

Basically, you are free to use this Framework to change and optimize it to your custom needs.
You can make web applications with it and sell it to your customers - the only thing you can't do, is selling this Framework. :) So have fun to work with it, you are welcome!
